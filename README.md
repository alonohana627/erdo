## My own C++ Adventures

This project doesn't really have any porpuse other than knowing better C++. Why? because C++ is complex, intriguing, bizzare and obscure. I love system programming. I love C.
C is simple, relaxed, and if you follow few rules your life will be easy. C++ is not.

## Examples for C++ bizzare traits
These traits are NOT C++ exclusive per-se but they are bloated out of the earth by C++:
- Rule of Five
- RAII and weird memory management.
- Template Metaprogramming
- Weird naming.
- `constexpr`, `consteval`, `constinit`, `const`.
- Verbosity that makes C code looks short.
- Annoying debugging.
